      <h3>Roblox</h3>
      <p>This game is a heavily underrated game it has great features and the limit for it is the sky with the impacting and amazing sandbox engine it provides developers to use and build a game they like for free, hence its ever unlimited potential although the community can be something you may want to stray away from with the influctation of toxicity</p>
      <p>Game Rating of 8/10</p>

      <h3>Gears of War! </h3>
      <p>This is a great action game with a light sight of gore where if you want you can abuse the system and wallbounce like you are in a bouncy castle and gain the advantage over the otherside although the connection and ping of this game is the more known issue and the heavy uses of the lancer emphasizes the lack of game skill</p>
      <p>Game Rating of 8/10</p>

      <h3>Halo</h3>
      <p>once was a great game and a masterpiece with the great works of bungie .But the introduction of 343 industries they couldnt have made a worse decision in thier lifetime to kill the game and ruin the plot where 343 had an amazing and outstanding unique idea of scrapping the masterpiece that halo once was and to create a new call of duty alien warfare</p>
      <p>Game Rating was 10/10 Now 7/10</p>
